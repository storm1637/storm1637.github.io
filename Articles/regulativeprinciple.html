<p>The regulative principle of worship in the Institutes by John Calvin:<br /><br />"...we are not to seek from men the doctrine of the true worship of God, for the Lord has faithfully and fully instructed us how he is to be worshipped." 4.10.8<br /><br />"There is nothing involved, nothing obscure, nothing ambiguous in these words which forbid the church universal to add or take away anything from God's Word, when the worship of the Lord and the precepts of salvation are concerned." 4.10.17<br /><br />"From this we gather that a part of the reverence that is paid to him consists simply in worshipping him as he commands, mingling no inventions of our own" 4.10.23<br /><br />"In short, every chance invention, by which men seek to worship God, is nothing but a pollution of true holiness." 4.10.25<br /><br />"It behooves me to declare that I approve only those human constitutions which are founded upon God's authority, drawn from Scripture, and, therefore, wholly divine." 4.10.29<br /><br />"If all voluntary worship which we ourselves devise apart from God's commandment is hateful to him, it follows that no worship can be acceptable&nbsp; to him except that which is approved by his Word." 4.13.2</p>
